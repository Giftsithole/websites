 	<p> We do events such as sports, olympics, weddings and business class meeting</p>
    	<p>The history of sports extends back to the Ancient world. <br>The physical activity
	 that developed into sports had early links with ritual, <br>warfare and entertainment.[1]

	Study of the history of sport can teach lessons about social changes <br>and about the nature 
	of sport itself, <br>as sport seems involved in the <br>development of basic human skills
 	(compare play).[citation needed]<br> As one delves further back in history, dwindling <br>evidence 
	makes theories of the origins<br> and purposes of sport more and more difficult to support.<br>

	As far back as the beginnings of sport, it was related to military training. <br>For example, competition
 	was used as a mean to determine whether individuals <br>were fit and useful for service.[citation needed]
	<br> Team sports were used to train and to prove the <br>capability to fight in the military and also to<br> 
	work together as a team (military unit).[2]</p>
	<p>A wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly 
	between cultures,<br> ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes. Most wedding ceremonies involve 
	an exchange of<br> marriage vows by a couple, presentation of a gift (offering, rings,<br> symbolic item, flowers, 
	money, dress), and<br> a public proclamation of marriage by <br>an authority figure or celebrant. <br>Special 
	wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception.<br> Music, 
	poetry, prayers, or readings from religious texts or<br> literature are also commonly incorporated into the 
	ceremony, as well as superstitious customs.</p>
	<p>MasterClass was founded by David Rogier while a student at Stanford University,
 	originally under the name "Yanka Industries". Rogier, who continues to serve as chief
 	executive officer (CEO), asked Aaron Rasmussen to join the company as a co-founder and chief technology
 	officer; Rasmussen would also serve as creative director, before leaving in January 2017. The website launched 
	under the MasterClass name on May 12, 2015.</p>
